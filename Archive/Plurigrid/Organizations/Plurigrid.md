Plurigrid is an intent-based coordination layer for energy markets. It is a 10-20 years or really ongoing endeavor.

It aims to balance cooperation and competition to allow diverse, disparate, value-pluralistic collaboration around efficient utilization of available energy capacity.

As we switch to renewable energy, and proliferation of microgrids - the capacity output by the energy grid is less predictable, and the energy resources are distributed and subject to heterogeneous local energy markets.

## Vision
Energy coordination and baseline level of access to electricity is a human right. ‚ö°Ô∏èüá∫üá≥

- **capital efficiency** - as a microgrid powered by solar ‚òÄÔ∏è  - can I go to the market and be sure that I am optimally allocating every $ 
- **value alignment** - not violating ethical standards of microgrid users while still coordinating in the grid
- **resilience** - in an event of a transmission failure - climate, natural disasters, war, political upheaval - the grid of grids needs to rapidly reconfigure itself or risk an outage
- **fraud prevention** - shift the enforcement of agreed upon energy distribution rules from human intermediaries / operators to math and code under certain well-understood corruptibility barriers

These are solved in the most abstract dynamical system way - as a species, we _know_ how to respond optimally in coordinating around these criteria.

However, when entering an energy spot market, each participant is operating within their own view of the grid and their own incentives, which may lead to individual decision making that in aggregate (all participants choosing to optimize on a very narrow view of profit etc.) lead to vulnerable grid. Optimal grid configuration found with simulated experiments of dynamical systems will incentivise prime market movers to adopt a resilient grid.

## Mission
Build coordination mechanisms and technology to carry coordination out so as to ensure faithful, verifiable, neutral adherence to IEEE 1547 and IEEE 2030 standards while standardising hardware efficiency. üí°

Industrial Control Systems innovation by replacing human intermediaries (DER operators) w/ applications of replicated state machines to record grid events from a variety of distributed autonomous grids, and ensure state transitions and actions are not subject to interpretation, but are instead deterministic executions of energy coordination protocol.

Provide _industry-leading models_ spot markets, fraud and anomaly detection, and other necessary models for DERs. Plurigrid models have to allow for concrete, measurable impacts on the various factors that DERs care about. ***

# Overview
## Problem we are solving
`TODO:` The established grid is 
## Energy - public good, human right !!!!!!
## Energy - critical infrastructure to secure
## Existing work (NREL, DER ) 
##  Where existing coordination efforts fall short
IEEE is not effective at implementing their standards and has no clue as to how to proceed.

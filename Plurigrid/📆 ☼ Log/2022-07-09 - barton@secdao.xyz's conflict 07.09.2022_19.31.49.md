# `$MATRIX` - simulation token from [[Plurigrid]]
- simulation token for self-bootstrapping network of value around running simulations of the grid
- airdrop to these organizations [[Xili Mo]]: << please add here -- orgs that we support that do simulation already (onboarding UX priority - easy flow with authorization)

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73071.pdf -- run simulations of energy grid as determined by this paper, starting with very simple [[cadcad]] sims and growing as `$MATRIX` allows for more simulations.

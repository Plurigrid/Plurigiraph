# Challenge
The Metaverse vision is a vision of surveillance and control. The more data is tracked, the more monetization potential for large platforms, the more fodder for centrally-held AI models, and the more algorithmically-driven engagement potential. Privacy is necessary for free expression, for diversity of interactions and identities, and often for safety, and yet it has become a luxury good, with privacy-preserving technologies remaining the preserve of those with knowledge or capital, not the default.
# Possibility
We must reimagine privacy as a public good, necessary to protect the green shoots of these transformational tendencies in a monopolized and surveilled world. Building from a foundation of [[distributed identity]] and verification based on personhood, not either state or stake, we will reclaim the digital sphere as one in which individuals and communities can act, grow, learn, deliberate, and agitate free of surveillance.

# Energy ⚡️
What do we lose when we put energy usage and energy trading on-chain?
What _do_ we put on chain?
Why?

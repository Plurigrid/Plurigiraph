Plurigrid is an idea. Like many of the best things nowadays, it is made of memes. One of those memes is to never be identified with the finite, forever wrong, occasionally useful models "on-chain" footprints, jurisdictional entities and associated paperwork, not even DAOs, or network states. Vehemently,  is it to be identified with any technologies that 
# Bootstrapping simulation economy
## Simulation categories
- **domain simulations** - energy and grid-related sims (NREL)
- **game simulation** - open games (cybercat), agent-based simulation aka token engineering (Tokenspice) - how do tokens contribute to creation of commons / incentives and direct behavior
- **infrastructure simulation** - (data availability, execution, consensus layers of replicated state machines) + message relaying infrastructure for communication between them + physical sensors and interfaces + MPC for private ML
- **agent-based simulation** (incl. adversary simulation) - can use okenSpice, cadCAD

It's in your head.
# What is our dystopia?
When creating anything with optimistic, or radically optimistic ~= utopian aspirations, it is informative to consider a dystopia of where you might end up if not attentive to unintended consequences.  For instance, for PG, it's [THX 1138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHgqfVQWv7s).
## Karl Popper Criterion
If Plugrid were to be any of the onchain entities or technologies associated with it, and since the current most significant onchain entity is arguably its [DAO on Jun√∏](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1z3zqgz7t0hcu2fx4wusuyjq0gc2m33la8l64saunfz7vmqwa2d5sz6jnep) - then

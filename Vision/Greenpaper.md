üëΩüí° **Plurigrid is an idea.**
Like a splinter in your mind, it beckons you to imagine a world where we can look past our differences when it comes to [things](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capitalist-realism-by-mark-fisher/id1502659321?i=1000471749869) that matter to _all_ of us. 

What unites this Commons is the fact that we see **baseline level of access to electricity as a universal human right** ‚ö°üîå  The right to have access to what one needs. 

[Plurigrid is a world]() where we can **address planetary scale challenges** and negative externalities everywhere, so that the sentient life can _make it_. Earthly life is sacred to Plurigrid. It is a word with a freedom to associate with those we like and agree with, and one where abundance grants us kindness towards those whom we merely accept. We not rugging the Individualatomic person of their sovereign subjectivity.

One meme is to never be identified with the forever wrong, occasionally useful models of reality, or any finite representations. Whether model weights or "on-chain" footprints of a much more nonfungible reality we inhabit. We can merely approach a "truthful" model of reality, but never inhabit it, for thinking we have truth condemns us to dogmatism.

The very concept of centralised govenance opens the door to power-leeches. Plurigrid is structurally designed to promote natural social organization according to one's own will. The metrics for success are our guiding star of openess, transparency, efficiency, power to all.

jurisdictional entities and associated paperwork, not even DAOs, or network states. Vehemently, it is not to be identified with any technologies that enable it today and any applications that it leads to need to always be evaluated against these **Guiding Star principles** ‚ú®
- we need a verifiably neutral [Energy Coordination Commons]()
- baseline level of access to electricity (e.g. for refrigeration) is a natural human right
- whole [Earth system]()
- the widespread means to flourishing
# Pluralism
Governance with fitted value sets that can allow people with similar energy use preferences/values to aggregate. This makes sure the universal adoption of pluralism and the end of hegemonic DER control. One must consider the Hobbesian hob of power that exercises a prohibitive power over "the people".  In our case, a prohibitive sovereign (interchain structure) is necessary to set the ground rules but not sufficient for accurate web3 governance models. Sufficiency comes from an integration of governance models, agent-based simulations, grid configuration with a simple, built-in core of value pluralism.

~We are the Grid~

## Bootstrapping simulation economy
TODO
## Simulation categories
- **domain simulations** - energy and grid-related sims (NREL [dGen](https://github.com/Plurigrid/dgen))
- **open game simulation** - open games (cybercat), agent-based simulation aka token engineering (Tokenspice) - how do tokens contribute to creation of commons / incentives and direct behavior
- **infrastructure simulation** - (data availability, execution, consensus layers of replicated state machines) + message relaying infrastructure for communication between them + physical sensors and interfaces + MPC for private ML
- **agent-based simulation** (incl. adversary simulation) - can use TokenSpice, [[../Technology/cadCAD]]

## What on üåè is Plurigrid? 
It's in your head.
## What is our dystopia?
When creating anything with optimistic, or radically optimistic ~= utopian aspirations, it is informative to consider a dystopia of where you might end up if not attentive to unintended consequences.  For instance, for PG, it's [THX 1138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHgqfVQWv7s). The dystopia where our assumption of human nature as one that strives for better lives falls through, leading to _vampiric tyrrany_.

Or, even contentment saturation. Or, the failure of memes. We imagine nightmares to better see our vision.

## Karl Popper Criterion
If Plugrid were to be any of the onchain entities or technologies associated with it, and since the current most significant onchain entity is arguably its [DAO on Jun√∏](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1z3zqgz7t0hcu2fx4wusuyjq0gc2m33la8l64saunfz7vmqwa2d5sz6jnep) - then since
[Jun√∏ is halted as of writing]() due to a malicious smart contract - new blocks don't get added) for the initial hatching of this particular Commons, this means

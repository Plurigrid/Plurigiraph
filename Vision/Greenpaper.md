**Plurigrid is an idea.** Like a splinter in your mind, it beckons you to imagine a world where **baseline level of access to clean electricity is a universal human right** ‚ö°üîå, a world where we can look past our differences when it comes to [things](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capitalist-realism-by-mark-fisher/id1502659321?i=1000471749869) that matter to _all_ of us.

[Plurigrid's is a world]() where we can **address planetary scale challenges** and negative externalities everywhere, so that the sentient life can _make it_. It is a word with a freedom to associate with those we like and agree with, and one where abundance grants us kindness towards those whom we merely accept. We not rugging the Individualatomic personof their sovereign subjectivity.

One meme is to never be identified with the forever wrong, occasionally useful models of reality, or any finite representations. Whether model weights or "on-chain" footprints of a much more nonfungible reality we inhabit.




jurisdictional entities and associated paperwork, not even DAOs, or network states. Vehemently, it is not to be identified with any technologies that enable it today and any applications that it leads to need to always be evaluated against these **Guiding Star principles** ‚ú®
- we need a verifiably neutral [Energy Coordination Commons]()
- baseline level of access to electricity (e.g. for refrigeration) is a human right
- whole Earth system

## Simulation categories
- **domain simulations** - energy and grid-related sims (NREL [dGen](https://github.com/Plurigrid/dgen))
- **game simulation** - open games (cybercat), agent-based simulation aka token engineering (Tokenspice) - how do tokens contribute to creation of commons / incentives and direct behavior
- **infrastructure simulation** - (data availability, execution, consensus layers of replicated state machines) + message relaying infrastructure for communication between them + physical sensors and interfaces + MPC for private ML
- **agent-based simulation** (incl. adversary simulation) - can use okenSpice, cadCAD

## What on üåè is Plurigrid? 
It's in your head.
# What is our dystopia?
When creating anything with optimistic, or radically optimistic ~= utopian aspirations, it is informative to consider a dystopia of where you might end up if not attentive to unintended consequences.  For instance, for PG, it's [THX 1138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHgqfVQWv7s).
## Karl Popper Criterion
If Plugrid were to be any of the onchain entities or technologies associated with it, and since the current most significant onchain entity is arguably its [DAO on Jun√∏](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1z3zqgz7t0hcu2fx4wusuyjq0gc2m33la8l64saunfz7vmqwa2d5sz6jnep) - then since
